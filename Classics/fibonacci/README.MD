# Concept

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the next few values in the sequence are:[1]

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, .


# Challenge 

Given a number N, we need to find the Fibonacci Series up to the N term.


# Examples
Input: N = 10 
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 
Here first term of Fibonacci is 0 and second is 1, so that 3rd term = first(o) + second(1) etc and so on.

Input: N = 15 
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377
